## 📱 Responsive Design

The UI is built **mobile-first**, then enhanced for larger screens using Tailwind breakpoints:

- Mobile: stacked layouts, compact spacing
- Tablet: balanced spacing, grid adjustments
- Desktop: wide layouts, larger typography

Key responsive patterns used:
- `flex-col md:flex-row`
- `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2`
- Responsive typography (`text-sm → text-xl`)
- Scalable spacing (`py-12 md:py-20`)
